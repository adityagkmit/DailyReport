Task-1: Perform aggregation function on “Track” table 
            a) Perform max on milliseconds.
            b) Perform min on bytes
            c) Perform sum on unit price

SELECT 
    MAX("Milliseconds") AS "Max Milliseconds",  -- Finds the maximum value in the Milliseconds column
    MIN("Bytes") AS "Min Bytes",                -- Finds the minimum value in the Bytes column
    SUM("UnitPrice") AS "Total UnitPrice"       -- Calculates the sum of all values in the UnitPrice column
FROM
    "Track";
  


Task-2: Calculate kilobyte / second using bytes and milliseconds from the “Track” table.

SELECT 
    "TrackId",                                   -- Track identifier
    "Name",                                      -- Track name
    ("Bytes" / 1024.0) / ("Milliseconds" / 1000.0) AS "KBps" -- Divides Bytes by 1024 to get Kilobytes, and Milliseconds by 1000 to get seconds, then divides Kilobytes by seconds
FROM 
    "Track";



 Task-3: Calculate the count of people by their ‘city’ and sort them alphabetically from the “Employee” table.

SELECT 
    "City",                                      -- Employee city
    COUNT("EmployeeId") AS "Employee Count"      -- Count of employees in each city
FROM
    "Employee"
GROUP BY 
    "City"                                       -- Group results by city
ORDER BY
    "City" ASC;                                  -- Sort cities alphabetically in ascending order



Task-4: Count the number of invoices in the range of Jan to March of 2009 using the invoice date and also calculate the sum of the total of invoices in that range.

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS "Invoice Count",                 -- Counts the total number of invoices within the date range
    SUM("Total") AS "Total Sum"                  -- Sums the total amount of all invoices in the date range
FROM 
    "Invoice"
WHERE 
    "InvoiceDate" BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-03-31'; -- Filters invoices between January 1, 2009, and March 31, 2009
